# videogames-sales-eda

In this repository you can find an exploratory analysis of data from the video game market. For this purpose, the dataset [Video Games Sales 2019](https://www.kaggle.com/ashaheedq/video-games-sales-2019) will be used as a basis

For the resolution of this case study, it will be assumed that a company specializing in video games has requested such a market analysis and that is the dataset that is given to us as a start (although we are not limited to use only that). In this way, an example presentation of the results that would be presented to this final client will be prepared.
